COMP 426 Final

 

Guidelines for what would get a passing (C or better) grade:

    Application loads as an HTML file with only one DOM load with everything else being done as a result of client-side programming. - Yes

    Retrieve and incorporate information from at least one endpoint in the API in the interface. - Yes, flights

    At least one interactive feature in your interface that dynamically alters / updates the interface as a result of some user initiated action. - Yes, slider, buttons

    At least use CSS (either rolled your own or from a framework), regardless of whether design is particularly good. - Yes, it is sexy

 

Guidelines for what would get a reasonable (B or better) grade:

    All of the above. - Yes as described

    Retrieve and incorporate information from at least three endpoints in the API. - Yes, flights, instances, airports

    Create and update information on the backend to at least one endpoint in the API. - Yes, updated is_cancelled in flight instances

    Use CSS effectively (i.e., application looks / feels nice to use). CSS frameworks OK. - Yes, made from scratch minus svg file and button animation

 

Guidelines for what would get a good (A- or better) grade:

    All of the above. - Yes, as described

    Create and update information on the backend to at least three endpoints in the API. - No

    At least one live interactive feature. By this, I mean that the interface updates somehow as the user is doing something like typing, moving a slider or something like that (autocomplete, live update of list or visualization, etc.). - Yes, live slider

    Incorporating one or more third party APIs (Google Maps is an obvious one, Twitter?, Facebook?, SoundCloud?). - Yes, openweather api

    Application has more than one "mode" (i.e., the interface gets torn down and rebuilt). - Yes, weather and city selection mode, flight information panel

    Excellent design using a framework, or reasonable design rolling your own from scratch CSS. - Multiple animated backgrounds depending on specified weather, button animations, fits page well, almost all from scratch

 
Your grade will also be affected by the quality of your presentation. You will be given approximately 10 minutes to present your final project.

 

Guidelines for your presentation:

    Everyone should have a speaking role.
    You should demonstrate the various features of your application, explaining which ones you found particularly challenging to implement and, if applicable, how you used any frameworks and/or 3rd party APIs.
    You should be able to answer questions about who did what.

 

Any and all resources (HTML page, CSS files, scripts, images, etc.) should be installed in a directory called "project" in one of your project members course web space. You can develop and even demo the app locally on your laptop and/or your own server or web host, but a working copy should also be in the course webspace.
